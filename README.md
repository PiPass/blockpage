PiPass is an extention to the Pi-Hole project which adds easy temporary unblocking functionality and a visually appealing blockpage. The whole project currently is written in PHP, so it will integrate very easily with your existing Pi-Hole system. The blockpage is very easy to use, presenting three distinct options, an automated, temporary unblock button among them.

Contributing
------
PiPass is an open-source project and relies on community support to stay alive. You may find problems in the code, in which I would strongly encourage you to create an issue, or if you're willing to solve it yourself, fork the repository and create a pull request. If you want a feature added, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/roenw/PiPass/issues).


A list of known caveats is at the bottom of this document. If you'd like to contribute but don't know how, check there for some ideas.

Prerequisites
------
* Pi-Hole server
  * Includes webserver and PHP already installed & configured (confirmed working on PHP version 7.3)
* SSH or direct terminal access
* SSL certificate for your Pi-Hole (self signed is ok) 
* PHP-CURL to check for new versions (``sudo apt update && sudo apt install php7.0-curl``)
Root (sudo) access to Pi-Hole
* Empty webroot - cannot contain index.html, index.php, etc.

Install
------
**Kubrick is undergoing maintenance at this time. Please expect intermittent downtime, it should be minimal.**

Installation on a vanilla Pi-Hole is completely automated. Execute ``bash <(wget -qO- https://kubrick.roen.us/pipass/scripts/install.sh)`` to install.

Please don't spam the installation script lots of times per minute!! The server has a firewall and might block your connection, if that happens, please email me if it doesn't unblock by itself.

If you have a more complex installation (e.g. using ``NGiNX`` as a webserver), follow these steps below.

1. Make your webserver redirect all 404 errors to the webroot. If you use ``lighttpd``, this function is automated.

For ``NGiNX``, this is

```
        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
                error_page 404 =200 http://$host;
        }
```

3. ``bash <(wget -qO- https://kubrick.roen.us/pipass/scripts/install.sh)`` - You may be prompted for elevated permissions using ``sudo``.

4. Optional: fill out the ``config.php`` configuration file.

Known Caveats
------

Future Ideas

* Admin console for PiPass (currently in the works)
* apt repository/package and Docker image
