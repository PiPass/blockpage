# Welcome!

The wiki is currently being developed. Some of the pages have been created and have basic information added to them. Some do not. Please bear with us while the wiki takes shape.

PiPass is a webpage which provides an interface to whitelist pages which are blocked by your PiHole blocklists. 


This project is the result of [@roenw](https://github.com/roenw)'s original work, with community support along the way. Community contributions by people like you keep this project alive.
